Introduction
------------

Pixel Artist is a fun little multiplayer game. You enter a lobby and draw a word. If you
are not drawing, you are guessing. Just spam whatever you assume into the chat.

The game is written in C# and uses the Unity engine.

If you find any bugs please inform me at <xrcore@aol.de>. Cheers!

Installation
------------

The repo includes all source files that are needed to build a working copy of the game in
Unity. However it is missing the GUI Skin, because I don't know if I can redistribute it. 
The game still works flawlessly however.
